Cyclistic Bike-Share Case Study
This repository contains the files, code, and documentation for a case study analyzing historical bike trip data from Cyclistic, a Chicago-based bike-share company. The goal is to identify trends in how casual riders and annual members use the bikes differently, with the aim of informing marketing strategies to convert casual riders into annual members.
This project was completed as part of a data analytics portfolio, using spreadsheets for initial cleaning, SQL for deeper manipulation and analysis, and Tableau for visualization.
